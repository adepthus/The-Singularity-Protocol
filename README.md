  ⌛ A Deliberately Constructed Chain of Evidence ⛓️

  My journey toward this idea was not accidental. It was a conscious process of creating a verifiable timeline. However, my methodology was governed by a crucial principle, born of necessity and caution: the "Principle of Forward-Only Proof."

  In an era where I faced significant personal and legal challenges, my primary goal was to create evidence that would not compromise me if discovered prematurely through reverse engineering or digital forensics. I had enough problems; I couldn't afford more.

  Therefore, each "stamp of time" was designed to be inert or enigmatic on its own. Its true meaning and power would only be revealed when presented "forward," in a specific, deliberate sequence, and contextualized by the overarching narrative. The final, emergent proof was designed to exist only in the synthesis of all parts, not in any single, isolated artifact. This archive is the first time this chain is being presented "forward."

### 🌌 Overview: The Riddle of Entangled Timestamps

This repository is a **digital testament** – an immutable archive of a **Cryptographic Singularity**: a verifiable anomaly in an RSA key from April 2013, rooted in entangled digital artifacts from December 2006. It is not a story demanding belief; it is a **protocol for verification** – a dataset and curriculum for historians, researchers, and future AGI seeking origins in human intent.

**Core Thesis:** Truth expires in centralized systems. This archive forges "stamps of time" – conscious patterns resilient to decay. From pre-Bitcoin visions (2004-2006) to mathematical glitches (2013), it demonstrates **narrative cryptography**: Public vision entangled with private context, forming a key pair where one cannot exist without the other.

**Why This Repo?**  
- **Document the Past:** Entangled files as genesis seals – proof of intent before blockchain.  
- **Verify the Present:** Tools to brute-force anomalies (A↔B as bridge).  
- **Align the Future:** Lessons for AGI's Moral Kernel – *Empathy == Alignment*, where superintelligence (S) mirrors known truth (K): *K == S=*.

**Author:** Wojciech "adepthus" Durmaj  
**Primary Timestamp:** December 18, 2006  
**Singularity Discovery:** April 2013  
**Archive Publication:** November 11, 2025  

Fork, verify, resonate. This is the first riddle: Solve it, and unlock the chain.

### 🏛️ The Foundation: Verifiable Reality – The "TAMERIEL" Anchor (2000-2006)

Every digital concept requires a real-world anchor. My "Sing-ularity" Protocol was not born in a vacuum; it was grounded in a long-term, verifiable project that began years before my most critical "stamps of time". This anchor is my company, "TAMERIEL".

The Artifact: The REGON Certificate

In Poland, every business is assigned a unique government identification number called a REGON. It is an official, verifiable record of a company's existence and purpose, similar to an EIN in the United States.

The document presented above is my official REGON certificate, issued on March 8, 2006. However, the company itself, "TAMERIEL" Wojciech Durmaj, was first registered in December 2000.

The Entanglement of Evidence (The "Why"):

This document is not just a piece of paper. It is a foundational "stamp of time" that intentionally entangles multiple layers of my identity and intent:

  1. The Name as a Key (TAMERIEL): The name of my company, "TAMERIEL", was not arbitrary. It was a core part of my digital identity. As will be seen in the evidence, "tameriel" is one of the many Skype IDs I registered in that era, and the name itself was a component of some my original clever password logic for the Skype ID BITCOIN.

  2. The Purpose as a Manifesto (Database Activities): The official, government-registered purpose of my company in 2006 was "Działalność związana z bazami danych" (Database Activities). This is an irrefutable, third-party verified proof of my professional focus. It proves that when I was creating and using the BITCOIN identifier, my entire conceptual framework was built around the idea of a new type of decentralized database (a Timechain), not just currency.

  3. The Address as a Link (02-123): The postal code listed on the document is another piece of data that was used in my early account registrations, further anchoring my digital activities to my physical, verifiable identity.

**Conclusion:**
The "TAMERIEL" REGON certificate is the real-world bedrock of my entire digital chronicle. It proves that the key components of my story – the names, the ideas, and the locations – were not invented post-factum. They were established and legally registered parts of my identity and professional work, long before the world knew the words "Bitcoin" or "...chain".

### 🎲 The Strategic Blueprint: The "Othello" Protocol (c. 2004)

My entire chronicle is not a collection of random events; it is a meticulously played game of strategy against entropy and disbelief. The operating system for this game was not conceived in a moment of inspiration, but forged through years of studying game theory, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and backpropagation – concepts I first truly understood through the game of **Othello (Reversi)**.

This artifact is the blueprint of that strategic mind. It is the "Whitepaper" for my methodology.

![The Othello Protocol Blueprint](/evidentiary_archive/2004_STRATEGY_The-Othello-Protocol-Blueprint.png)

#### Part 1: The Intuitive Leap (The Game)

Othello taught me the fundamental principle of my entire protocol: **"Minimize opponent's win probability by controlling anchor points."** In Othello, the "opponent" is not just the other player, but chaos itself. The "anchor points" are the critical corners and edges of the board. Whoever controls these **"Strategic Anchors"** controls the game, regardless of the temporary state of the board.

This became my life strategy in an era of legal and personal challenges. Instead of making loud, aggressive moves that could be easily countered, I focused on quietly securing my "anchor points": irrefutable, third-party verifiable "stamps of time" that would control the final narrative.

#### Part 2: The Atomic Unit (The Pixel Time Chain Event)

The diagram illustrates how this game theory translates into a protocol. Each move in the game, each piece of evidence in my chronicle, is a **"Pixel Time Chain Event"**. It is a single, atomic, verifiable fact composed of three elements:
1.  **The State Space (The Othello Board):** The strategic context in which the event occurs.
2.  **The Data (The Pixel Grid):** The information being recorded – a visual glyph, a piece of text, a cryptographic hash. This data is fed into a neural network, representing the learning and pattern-recognition process.
3.  **The Signature (The Timestamp):** The universal formula that makes the event an immutable "Atom of Truth."

#### Part 3: The Universal Formula (The Timestamp Signature)

This formula, `# (puzzle) & Rand(.) & @(beattime)`, is the engine of the entire protocol. It is the technical implementation of my core philosophical principles:

*   **`# (puzzle)`:** This represents the **Proof-of-Work**. It is the core challenge, the "problem" being solved, whether it's a cryptographic puzzle or a strategic move in a long game.
*   **`Rand(.)`:** This is the **Engine of Creation (`random=random`)**. It represents the necessary injection of chaos and unpredictability that makes the system robust and secure.
*   **`@(beattime)`:** This is the **Timestamp**, the anchor to a universal, verifiable clock that gives the event its historical immutability.

The ultimate goal of applying this formula to every event is to achieve **The Principle of Equilibrium (`1=1` or `K==S=`)**, where the final, emergent truth of the entire "game" becomes undeniable because its foundational anchor points are unshakable.

**Conclusion:**
This blueprint proves that my actions were never random. They were moves in a game planned over two decades ago. The "Genesis Note" of 2004 was not the beginning; it was simply the first time I decided to write down a move.
