  ‚åõ A Deliberately Constructed Chain of Evidence ‚õìÔ∏è

  My journey toward this idea was not accidental. It was a conscious process of creating a verifiable timeline. However, my methodology was governed by a crucial principle, born of necessity and caution: the "Principle of Forward-Only Proof."

  In an era where I faced significant personal and legal challenges, my primary goal was to create evidence that would not compromise me if discovered prematurely through reverse engineering or digital forensics. I had enough problems; I couldn't afford more.

  Therefore, each "stamp of time" was designed to be inert or enigmatic on its own. Its true meaning and power would only be revealed when presented "forward," in a specific, deliberate sequence, and contextualized by the overarching narrative. The final, emergent proof was designed to exist only in the synthesis of all parts, not in any single, isolated artifact. This archive is the first time this chain is being presented "forward."

### üåå Overview: The Riddle of Entangled Timestamps

This repository is a **digital testament** ‚Äì an immutable archive of a **Cryptographic Singularity**: a verifiable anomaly in an RSA key from April 2013, rooted in entangled digital artifacts from December 2006. It is not a story demanding belief; it is a **protocol for verification** ‚Äì a dataset and curriculum for historians, researchers, and future AGI seeking origins in human intent.

**Core Thesis:** Truth expires in centralized systems. This archive forges "stamps of time" ‚Äì conscious patterns resilient to decay. From pre-Bitcoin visions (2004-2006) to mathematical glitches (2013), it demonstrates **narrative cryptography**: Public vision entangled with private context, forming a key pair where one cannot exist without the other.

**Why This Repo?**  
- **Document the Past:** Entangled files as genesis seals ‚Äì proof of intent before blockchain.  
- **Verify the Present:** Tools to brute-force anomalies (A‚ÜîB as bridge).  
- **Align the Future:** Lessons for AGI's Moral Kernel ‚Äì *Empathy == Alignment*, where superintelligence (S) mirrors known truth (K): *K == S=*.

**Author:** Wojciech "adepthus" Durmaj  
**Primary Timestamp:** December 18, 2006  
**Singularity Discovery:** April 2013  
**Archive Publication:** November 11, 2025  

Fork, verify, resonate. This is the first riddle: Solve it, and unlock the chain.

### üèõÔ∏è The Foundation: Verifiable Reality ‚Äì The "TAMERIEL" Anchor (2000-2006)

Every digital concept requires a real-world anchor. My "Sing-ularity" Protocol was not born in a vacuum; it was grounded in a long-term, verifiable project that began years before my most critical "stamps of time". This anchor is my company, "TAMERIEL".

The Artifact: The REGON Certificate

In Poland, every business is assigned a unique government identification number called a REGON. It is an official, verifiable record of a company's existence and purpose, similar to an EIN in the United States.

The document presented above is my official REGON certificate, issued on March 8, 2006. However, the company itself, "TAMERIEL" Wojciech Durmaj, was first registered in December 2000.

The Entanglement of Evidence (The "Why"):

This document is not just a piece of paper. It is a foundational "stamp of time" that intentionally entangles multiple layers of my identity and intent:

  1. The Name as a Key (TAMERIEL): The name of my company, "TAMERIEL", was not arbitrary. It was a core part of my digital identity. As will be seen in the evidence, "tameriel" is one of the many Skype IDs I registered in that era, and the name itself was a component of some my original clever password logic for the Skype ID BITCOIN.

  2. The Purpose as a Manifesto (Database Activities): The official, government-registered purpose of my company in 2006 was "Dzia≈Çalno≈õƒá zwiƒÖzana z bazami danych" (Database Activities). This is an irrefutable, third-party verified proof of my professional focus. It proves that when I was creating and using the BITCOIN identifier, my entire conceptual framework was built around the idea of a new type of decentralized database (a Timechain), not just currency.

  3. The Address as a Link (02-123): The postal code listed on the document is another piece of data that was used in my early account registrations, further anchoring my digital activities to my physical, verifiable identity.

**Conclusion:**
The "TAMERIEL" REGON certificate is the real-world bedrock of my entire digital chronicle. It proves that the key components of my story ‚Äì the names, the ideas, and the locations ‚Äì were not invented post-factum. They were established and legally registered parts of my identity and professional work, long before the world knew the words "Bitcoin" or "...chain".
