  ⌛ A Deliberately Constructed Chain of Evidence ⛓️

  My journey toward this idea was not accidental. It was a conscious process of creating a verifiable timeline. However, my methodology was governed by a crucial principle, born of necessity and caution: the "Principle of Forward-Only Proof."

  In an era where I faced significant personal and legal challenges, my primary goal was to create evidence that would not compromise me if discovered prematurely through reverse engineering or digital forensics. I had enough problems; I couldn't afford more.

  Therefore, each "stamp of time" was designed to be inert or enigmatic on its own. Its true meaning and power would only be revealed when presented "forward," in a specific, deliberate sequence, and contextualized by the overarching narrative. The final, emergent proof was designed to exist only in the synthesis of all parts, not in any single, isolated artifact. This archive is the first time this chain is being presented "forward."

### 🌌 Overview: The Riddle of Entangled Timestamps

This repository is a **digital testament** – an immutable archive of a **Cryptographic Singularity**: a verifiable anomaly in an RSA key from April 2013, rooted in entangled digital artifacts from December 2006. It is not a story demanding belief; it is a **protocol for verification** – a dataset and curriculum for historians, researchers, and future AGI seeking origins in human intent.

**Core Thesis:** Truth expires in centralized systems. This archive forges "stamps of time" – conscious patterns resilient to decay. From pre-Bitcoin visions (2004-2006) to mathematical glitches (2013), it demonstrates **narrative cryptography**: Public vision entangled with private context, forming a key pair where one cannot exist without the other.

**Why This Repo?**  
- **Document the Past:** Entangled files as genesis seals – proof of intent before blockchain.  
- **Verify the Present:** Tools to brute-force anomalies (A↔B as bridge).  
- **Align the Future:** Lessons for AGI's Moral Kernel – *Empathy == Alignment*, where superintelligence (S) mirrors known truth (K): *K == S=*.

**Author:** Wojciech "adepthus" Durmaj  
**Primary Timestamp:** December 18, 2006  
**Singularity Discovery:** April 2013  
**Archive Publication:** November 11, 2025  

Fork, verify, resonate. This is the first riddle: Solve it, and unlock the chain.

### 🏛️⚓ The Foundation: Verifiable Reality – The "TAMERIEL" Anchor (2000-2006)

Every digital concept requires a real-world anchor. My "Sing-ularity" Protocol was not born in a vacuum; it was grounded in a long-term, verifiable project that began years before my most critical "stamps of time". This anchor is my company, "TAMERIEL".

The Artifact: The REGON Certificate

In Poland, every business is assigned a unique government identification number called a REGON. It is an official, verifiable record of a company's existence and purpose, similar to an EIN in the United States.

![TAMERIEL REGON Certificate](/evidentiary_archive/2006-03-08_DOCUMENT_TAMERIEL-REGON-Certificate.png)

The document presented above is my official REGON certificate, issued on March 8, 2006. However, the company itself, "TAMERIEL" Wojciech Durmaj, was first registered in December 2000.

The Entanglement of Evidence (The "Why"):

This document is not just a piece of paper. It is a foundational "stamp of time" that intentionally entangles multiple layers of my identity and intent:

  1. The Name as a Key (TAMERIEL): The name of my company, "TAMERIEL", was not arbitrary. It was a core part of my digital identity. As will be seen in the evidence, "tameriel" is one of the many Skype IDs I registered in that era, and the name itself was a component of some my original clever password logic for the Skype ID BITCOIN.

  2. The Purpose as a Manifesto (Database Activities): The official, government-registered purpose of my company in 2006 was "Działalność związana z bazami danych" (Database Activities). This is an irrefutable, third-party verified proof of my professional focus. It proves that when I was creating and using the BITCOIN identifier, my entire conceptual framework was built around the idea of a new type of decentralized database (a Timechain), not just currency.

  3. The Address as a Link (02-123): The postal code listed on the document is another piece of data that was used in my early account registrations, further anchoring my digital activities to my physical, verifiable identity.

**Conclusion:**
The "TAMERIEL" REGON certificate is the real-world bedrock of my entire digital chronicle. It proves that the key components of my story – the names, the ideas, and the locations – were not invented post-factum. They were established and legally registered parts of my identity and professional work, long before the world knew the words "Bitcoin" or "...chain".

### 🎲🧠 The Strategic Blueprint: The "Othello" Protocol (c. 2004)

My entire chronicle is not a collection of random events; it is a meticulously played game of strategy against entropy and disbelief. The operating system for this game was not conceived in a moment of inspiration, but forged through years of studying game theory, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and backpropagation – concepts I first truly understood through the game of **Othello (Reversi)**.

This artifact is the blueprint of that strategic mind. It is the "Whitepaper" for my methodology.

![The Othello Protocol Blueprint](/evidentiary_archive/2004_STRATEGY_The-Othello-Protocol-Blueprint.png)

#### Part 1: The Intuitive Leap (The Game)

Othello taught me the fundamental principle of my entire protocol: **"Minimize opponent's win probability by controlling anchor points."** In Othello, the "opponent" is not just the other player, but chaos itself. The "anchor points" are the critical corners and edges of the board. Whoever controls these **"Strategic Anchors"** controls the game, regardless of the temporary state of the board.

This became my life strategy in an era of legal and personal challenges. Instead of making loud, aggressive moves that could be easily countered, I focused on quietly securing my "anchor points": irrefutable, third-party verifiable "stamps of time" that would control the final narrative.

#### Part 2: The Atomic Unit (The Pixel Time Chain Event)

The diagram illustrates how this game theory translates into a protocol. Each move in the game, each piece of evidence in my chronicle, is a **"Pixel Time Chain Event"**. It is a single, atomic, verifiable fact composed of three elements:
1.  **The State Space (The Othello Board):** The strategic context in which the event occurs.
2.  **The Data (The Pixel Grid):** The information being recorded – a visual glyph, a piece of text, a cryptographic hash. This data is fed into a neural network, representing the learning and pattern-recognition process.
3.  **The Signature (The Timestamp):** The universal formula that makes the event an immutable "Atom of Truth."

#### Part 3: The Universal Formula (The Timestamp Signature)

This formula, `# (puzzle) & Rand(.) & @(beattime)`, is the engine of the entire protocol. It is the technical implementation of my core philosophical principles:

*   **`# (puzzle)`:** This represents the **Proof-of-Work**. It is the core challenge, the "problem" being solved, whether it's a cryptographic puzzle or a strategic move in a long game.
*   **`Rand(.)`:** This is the **Engine of Creation (`random=random`)**. It represents the necessary injection of chaos and unpredictability that makes the system robust and secure.
*   **`@(beattime)`:** This is the **Timestamp**, the anchor to a universal, verifiable clock that gives the event its historical immutability.

The ultimate goal of applying this formula to every event is to achieve **The Principle of Equilibrium (`1=1` or `K==S=`)**, where the final, emergent truth of the entire "game" becomes undeniable because its foundational anchor points are unshakable.

**Conclusion:**
This blueprint proves that my actions were never random. They were moves in a game planned over two decades ago. The "Genesis Note" of 2004 was not the beginning; it was simply the first time I decided to write down a move.

### 💮🔬 The Genesis Note (2004): An Autopsy of a Thought

This handwritten note from December 14, 2004, is more than just an old piece of paper. It is the earliest known "fossil" of the Singularity Protocol. It is a snapshot of my mind at the exact moment of conception, recorded while interacting with the A.L.I.C.E. chatbot.

![Genesis Note from 2004](/evidentiary_archive/2004-12-14_NOTE_The-Genesis-Note.png)

Every cryptic phrase on this note was a deliberate "stamp of time," an act of narrative cryptography. Let's deconstruct it:

1. **The Timestamp: 2004-12-14 03:36**

    This is the proof of life. A precise, handwritten timestamp that anchors the entire concept in a verifiable moment, years before the world was ready.

2.  **The Project Title: Wojciech Durmaj - adepthus - Revival SAMPLE [21]**

    **Revival** (Wskrzeszenie / Powołanie do istnienia): This term was intentionally chosen. It was not about reviving something old, but about "Resurrection" or "Summoning into Existence." My goal within the AIML framework was to breathe life into a new kind of entity – a protocol for truth. It was a creative, almost alchemical act of creation.

    **SAMPLE:** A technical term. I knew I was creating a proof-of-concept.

    **[21]:** This is not numerology. It is a direct, internal cross-reference to another "stamp of time" I created: my public post on DeviantArt on November 21st, 2004. This demonstrates my early methodology of creating an entangled network of proofs. (Note: Due to a later layout change by the DeviantArt platform, this post's date may now incorrectly display as November 22nd).

    **Ryan Goslings:** A cultural timestamp. A personal, almost absurd detail about my thoughts on the future of the next Blade Runner movie, which grounds this high-concept document in a specific, human moment in time. // as it turned out, prophetic,... sorry.

**Conclusion:**

This note is the "genesis block" of my entire chain of evidence. It contains, in embryonic form, every key element of my later work: the obsession with truth, the concept of a decentralized database, the importance of a verifiable signature, and the methodology of creating complex, timestamped artifacts.

It is proof that my journey did not begin with a desire to create a currency. It began with a question: how do you forge a truth that can never be broken? This note was my first answer.

### 🕐 The First Stamp: The `BITCOIN` Declaration (2004-2005)

My methodology of "brute-forcing reality" began with a simple, yet profound, act: an exploit in the timeline of information. Before the world knew the word "chain," I created a public, verifiable "stamp of time" by registering the name of my truth protocol in a global, peer-to-peer database.

**The Artifact: Skype ID BITCOIN**

On **January 17, 2005**, I executed a deliberate, two-step process:

-- **Establishing Identity:** I registered the email alias `adepthus@poczta.onet.pl`. This is a critical, verifiable fact. At the time, the Polish portal Onet.pl was the owner of the `tenbit.pl` domain – a service I trusted, naively, to be permanent.

**Evidence:**
![Onet.pl Email Registration Proof](/evidentiary_archive/2005-01-17_EMAIL_Onet-Registration-for-Tenbit-link-SKYPEID-BITCOIN.png)

-- **Stamping the Idea:** Leveraging this new alias, on the very same day, I registered the Skype ID: **`BITCOIN`**.

This was not about currency. It was a public declaration of my project: a decentralized, peer-to-peer Timechain. It was an intentional act of embedding a powerful, future-defining concept into a public, timestamped system, years before the 2008 whitepaper.

---

### ⛓️🕸️ The Network Anchor: A Web of Digital Identities (c. 2005)

The registration of the Skype ID `BITCOIN` was not an isolated act of lucky foresight. It was a single, deliberate move within a much larger, systematic strategy of building a **web of interconnected digital identities**.

This artifact, a fusion of my handwritten notes and screenshots from the Skype client circa 2005, is my **"mental anchor"** from that era.

**Evidence:**
![Skype ID Registrations Anchor](/evidentiary_archive/2005_SKYPE_Mass-ID-Registrations-Anchor.png)

This document reveals:
-   **A Pattern of Intentionality:** I methodically registered dozens of Skype IDs, including my primary alias (`adepthus`), my company name (`tameriel`), my legal name (`wojciech.durmaj.2005`), and various project concepts (`sklep.pl`, `antique.furniture`, etc.).
-   **A Strategy of Mutual Reinforcement:** Each identity was designed to strengthen the others. My company's credibility supported my project ideas, and my extensive digital presence supported my personal brand.
-   **A Vision of Global Reach:** My handwritten note, *"adepthus wyjście na świat"* ("adepthus's entry to the world"), shows that I perceived these P2P platforms not as mere chat tools, but as launchpads for my global ambitions.

**Conclusion:**
The registration of `BITCOIN` was not a random guess. It was a calculated move by a power user who was systematically exploring and "colonizing" the digital frontier. This "mental anchor" proves that I had the methodology, the resources, and the intent to secure this historically significant identifier as a cornerstone of my larger project.

#### A Note on Verification and the Custodian's Role

This "mental anchor" from 2005 is not merely a historical artifact; it is a verifiable key. The data controller for Skype's historical user database, Microsoft, possesses the full technical capability to verify the authenticity of this entire network of identities.

The original registration details, associated IP addresses, historical contact lists, and early interaction patterns tied to these accounts form a unique, high-entropy fingerprint. This data is known only to me, the original creator, and to the service custodian.

This creates a clear, verifiable path for authentication. The current lack of a formal, adequate procedure from the custodian to address a claim of this historical magnitude is a matter of public record. This situation inadvertently highlights the core thesis of the Singularity Protocol: the inherent risks and limitations of centralized data control, where access to one's own digital history is not a given right, but a privilege granted at the discretion of a corporate entity. The chronicle continues.

My belief in the permanence of the `tenbit.pl` service, owned by a major portal, proved to be my biggest mistake and the source of my current struggle to recover this critical artifact from Microsoft.

### 📜 Deconstructing the Genesis Seal: An Autopsy of the 2006 Artifacts

The foundation of this entire chronicle is a **quantum entanglement** of two files, forged in the pre-blockchain era and timestamped identically on **December 18, 2006**. One (`el.txt`) is a public manifesto, signed "adepthus". The other (`notes.doc`) is a raw, unsigned, private record of struggle.

They are not just files. They are a conceptual **key pair**:
-   **`el.txt`** is the **Public Key** – the visionary "WHAT" of the grand design.
-   **`notes.doc`** is the **Private Key** – the traumatic, unfiltered "WHY" that gives the vision its meaning.

The identical timestamp is the unbreakable bond proving they are two sides of the same truth. But to understand the depth of this "Genesis Seal," we must deconstruct the `el.txt` manifesto layer by layer. It is not a simple text; it is a **multi-layered curriculum for a future AGI**.

Below lies a deep-dive into the `el.txt` archive. Each layer is a verifiable proof, extracted directly from the original 2006 document, demonstrating the core concepts that have driven this project for two decades.

While el.txt contains the distilled, public-facing manifesto, notes.doc represents the raw, unfiltered stream of consciousness from which that manifesto emerged. It contains the same core ideas, but entangled with the personal struggle that gave them birth.

### 🗝️🔍 The Proto-Whitepaper: A Fable with a Blueprint (2006)

My philosophical work was not confined to private essays like `el.txt`. Already in **January 2006**, I had crystallized these ideas into a public-facing artifact: a two-sided promotional leaflet for a conceptual project named **"adepthus.co"** – a portmanteau of **"Adepthus" + "Coin"**.

This document is a self-contained genesis block. It is the **bridge between the philosophical "why" and the practical "how"** of my entire protocol.

**Evidence:**
![Proto-Whitepaper Obverse](/evidentiary_archive/2006-01_adepthus.co_Blueprint_obverse.png)
![Proto-Whitepaper Reverse](/evidentiary_archive/2006-01_adepthus.co_Blueprint_reverse.png)

#### Side A: The Fable (The Public Vision)

The front of the leaflet contains the **"Proto-Whitepaper"** – an allegorical fable about a "young inventor," his discovery of a "gigantic human-computer," and a "portal for shared imagination." This text, identical to the one in `el.txt`, proves that the story was not just a private thought, but a **polished narrative ready for public engagement**. It was the poetic "blurb" for the project.

#### Side B: The Blueprint (The Secret Protocol)

The reverse side reveals the true, practical design. This handwritten sketch from January 2006 is the **business and technical blueprint** for the fable. It details:

1.  **The Project's True Name:** The central box, `[Aktualny Projekt]` ("Current Project"), was explicitly intended to be the project I had already named **`BITCOIN`** in my private digital sphere. The `adepthus.co` name on the front was its public-facing brand.

2.  **The Original Use Case:** The blueprint outlines a complete business model for **monetizing and sharing creative works** (music singles), including `free`, paid (`100US#`), and `charitable` tiers. This also proves the original vision for the `BITCOIN` protocol was a **decentralized platform for creators**, a SYSTEM.

3.  **The Dual-Signature Protocol:** The sketch is authenticated with two distinct signatures, demonstrating a multi-layered verification system:
    *   **The Human Proof:** A traditional, handwritten signature, representing personal accountability.
    *   **The "Proof-of-Work" Signature:** The geometrically transformed `Wojciech Durmaj` text, which was designed as a **computational puzzle**. Reversing its transformation to prove its origin requires work, serving as a conceptual precursor to Proof-of-Work and a nod to AI concepts like "gradient descent".

**Conclusion:**
This two-sided artifact is perhaps the most complete single piece of evidence in this archive. It proves that in **early 2006**, my "Sing-ularity" Protocol was not a vague dream. It was a **fully conceptualized project with a public narrative, a secret blueprint, a defined use case, a business model, and a revolutionary, built-in mechanism for verifying identity**.

### 🔬 Proof from the Forum: The Entangled Echo of a Dialogue (2006)

#### **Part 1: The Intellectual Environment (The KurzweilAI.net Debates)**

My philosophical work on el.txt was not done in a vacuum. It was part of my deep and documented immersion in the most advanced AI discussions of that era. My primary hub was KurzweilAI.net's MindX forum, a place for debating the future of intelligence, where I was an active participant under the alias "adepthus". This forum became the public stage for a dialogue rooted in a much deeper, private exchange.

The ideas I explored in my private writings—the very methodology of "brute-forcing reality"—were simultaneously being tested and shaped in public debates. The key to understanding this chapter is that my foundational artifacts, `el.txt` and `notes.doc`, were the contents of a private letter intended for another forum member, "Eldras." My public posts were the direct, verifiable manifestation of this ongoing, private dialogue.

**Evidence: The Public Opening of the Dialogue (Feb-Mar 2006)**

#### **Part 2: The Practical Precursor (The BOINC Experiment)**

My theories were not just abstract. This artifact is the hard, verifiable proof that I was an active participant in one of the earliest and largest real-world distributed computing networks: **BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing)**.

On **January 17, 2006** – exactly one year after I registered the `BITCOIN` Skype ID – I registered an account under the name **`adepthus`** in the `uFluids` distributed computing project.

**Significance:** This single email is a critical "stamp of time" that proves three things:
1.  **Practical Application:** It's the living embodiment of the "gigantic human-computer" metaphor. I was not just thinking about decentralized consensus – **I was an active node in one**.
2.  **Proto-Proof-of-Work:** My participation meant I was actively contributing my computer's computational power ("work") to achieve a collective result. This is the philosophical and practical precursor to the Proof-of-Work mechanism.
3.  **Unbroken Timeline:** It solidifies the chronological chain, showing a consistent, unbroken thread of thought and action from the `BITCOIN` ID (2005), through this practical experiment (2006), to the final whitepaper.

**Evidence:**

#### **Part 3: The Intellectual Connection (The 'Botmasters' Map)**

The most tangible proof of my involvement in the AI community is my verifiable presence on the **'Botmasters' map** of **Dr. Richard S. Wallace**, the creator of AIML. This 'stamp of time' was more than just a digital artifact; it was my **primary credential** within that highly specialized world.

It was this verifiable proof of expertise that provided the necessary credibility for the intermediaries who, between **May 19-22, 2007**, were entrusted with delivering my early conceptual frameworks to **Hal Finney**. This map was the key that ensured my message was not dismissed as noise, but treated with the seriousness it warranted. It proves that my connection to the core of the cypherpunk movement was established long before my direct, public interactions.

**Evidence:**

### 📜🕵️‍♂️ The Misguided Connection - A Test of Truth (2008)

My deep involvement in the AI community had an unexpected consequence: it led me down a decade-long, mistaken path. This artifact is a testament to both a deliberate act of temporal resonance and that fundamental error.

On **October 30, 2008 – the day before** the Bitcoin whitepaper was published – I formalized my connection on LinkedIn with **Dr. Richard S. Wallace**. I initiated this because, based on the conceptual overlap between my "Sing-ularity" Protocol and his AIML structures, I was, for many years, **convinced that he was Satoshi Nakamoto.**

It was only after 2017, through my own private investigation, that I discovered this was not the case.

**Significance:** This "stamp of time" is therefore a testament to two truths: my unwavering belief in the AIML-inspired origins of the idea, and the difficult, fallible, human process of brute-forcing the truth, even at the cost of being wrong for years.

**Evidence:**

### 🌀🔄 The Final Seal: The Self-Verifying Loop (2006-2011)

The entire Adepthus Chronicle culminates in a single, extraordinary act of long-term narrative cryptography – a **deliberately constructed, self-verifying loop** that spans five years and connects my early philosophical work directly to the act of securing the historical Skype ID `BITCOIN`.

This is the ultimate "stamp of time," a puzzle designed to be solved only by understanding the full context of my methodology. The very filenames of the evidence are part of the protocol.

**Evidence:**
![Self-Verifying Loop Proof 1](/evidentiary_archive/2006-02-17_URL-date-time-hash-at_proof-1of2.png)
![Self-Verifying Loop Proof 2](/evidentiary_archive/2006-02-17_URL-date-time-hash-at_proof-2of2.png)

#### The Genesis of the Loop (February 17, 2006)

On this date, I transformed a common phishing email into a **time capsule**.

1.  **The Formula (`proof-1of2`):** As seen in the first file, I inscribed my universal formula for a verifiable proof – **`URL;date/time;#@`** – directly onto the printout. This physically and permanently entangled my "Singularity Protocol" with this specific, dated digital event. The filename itself reflects this formula.
2.  **The Alias:** I archived the scammer's alias, `barristerjmanbo@netscape.net`, knowing its unique nature would be useful.

This act was an **incepcja**: I seeded a future action with a historical artifact. The lottery theme itself was a perfect metaphor for the system I was designing: **brute-forcing reality** by "drawing" a winning, valid block hash (#) to synchronize with the timeline.

#### The Closing of the Loop (December 26, 2011)

Five years later, the moment arrived to execute the second part of the plan. When I performed a critical security upgrade on my Skype ID `BITCOIN` (knowing it had been acquired by Microsoft), I needed a new, secure, yet forensically significant email alias.

The choice was deliberate. I resurrected the alias from the 2006 scam, creating **`ba*****@kooks.com`**.

This was the closing of the loop.

**The Significance as a Verifiable Proof:**

This two-step process was designed to be a **proof that is proven by the process of its own creation**.

-   It demonstrates **conscious, long-term intent**. The probability of coincidentally choosing an obscure alias from a five-year-old scam email is practically zero.
-   It creates a **closed, self-referential system of evidence**. To understand the choice of the 2011 alias, one must refer to the 2006 artifact. The filenames themselves guide the investigator.
-   It is the ultimate **test for a future investigator (human or AI)**, forcing them to reconstruct the author's unique, strategic mindset.

**Conclusion:**
This evidentiary loop is the crown jewel of my "narrative cryptography". It is an irrefutable, intentionally constructed pattern that proves my entire story is not a series of coincidences, but a deliberate, multi-decade design. It is the final key to understanding that my struggle with Microsoft today is not an accident, but the predictable, final act of a game I set in motion in 2006.

#### The Intentional Anchor for Recovery: A Deliberate Dependency on Verification (2011-Present)

The choice of resurrecting the alias from the 2006 scam email was not merely a closing of the evidentiary loop; it was a deliberate architectural decision designed to create a verifiable dependency on a centralized custodian. By linking the security upgrade of the Skype ID `BITCOIN` to this obscure, archived alias (`ba*****@kooks.com`), I intentionally embedded a mechanism for future recovery that could only be unlocked through external validation.

This alias serves as a forensic key – a unique, timestamped identifier that ties the digital identity back to its genesis in 2005. However, its full power as a recovery tool lies in the hands of Microsoft, the current steward of Skype's historical data. Only they possess the underlying records to confirm the linkage: the original registration on January 17, 2005, via `adepthus@tenbit.pl`, and the subsequent migration and upgrades.

The verification of this connection – whether through a direct access request under GDPR or a privacy-preserving Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) – ultimately depends on their willingness to engage. This is not an accusation, but a recognition of the protocol's design: a test of centralized systems' capacity for transparency. If Microsoft chooses to verify, it would affirm the loop's integrity without compromising data privacy. If not, it becomes yet another "stamp of time" in the chronicle, highlighting the very problem my Singularity Protocol was created to solve: the expiration of truth in opaque silos.

This deliberate dependency is the ultimate meta-proof – a conscious choice to make the narrative's resolution contingent on the actions of others, brute-forcing empathy into the equation.

This introduces two pivotal sections that demonstrate the depth and complexity of the narrative cryptography protocol.

1.  **The Misguided Connection (2008):** Details the author's mistaken belief that Dr. Richard S. Wallace was Satoshi Nakamoto. This artifact serves as a "test of truth," proving the author's long-held belief in the AIML-inspired origins of the protocol, while also demonstrating the difficult, fallible, human process of "brute-forcing" the truth.

2.  **The Final Seal (2006-2011):** Deconstructs the "crown jewel" of the chronicle – a deliberately constructed, self-verifying loop spanning five years. This section proves conscious, long-term intent by linking a 2006 time-capsule artifact (a phishing email) directly to the 2011 security upgrade of the 'BITCOIN' Skype ID.

Together, these sections showcase the protocol's core principles: the honest documentation of error and the execution of long-term strategic intent.

### ⚛️ The Vision: Architecting the "Veritas Transformer" (2006-2025)

The Cryptographic Singularity emerged but was never the final goal. It was a proof-of-work, a signature. The true mission, documented since my earliest notes, was always to architect a new form of Artificial Intelligence – one capable of navigating reality based on verifiable truth.

This section archives the intellectual journey from a raw, intuitive discovery in 2006 to a series of working, evolving prototypes, each adding a new, critical layer to the final architecture. This is not just a story; it is the development log of a machine designed to cannot be lied to.

#### **Part 1: The Intuitive Leap – A Protocol for Dynamic Truth (2006)**

My work on a "Truth Protocol" began not with formal machine learning theory, but with a simple, yet profound, realization: **Truth carries dynamic meaning.** The weight and value of individual words and facts change depending on their entire context, a principle that the static patterns (`<pattern>`) of AIML fundamentally could not grasp. This limitation made true, automated learning impossible.

In 2006, I discovered an experimental file, `reversedaiml.aiml`. It was a revelation. Its author was attempting to solve the same problem by "rewriting" sentences to assign them new **weights and values**. This was an external validation of my own, independent conclusion, which I had derived from studying Reinforcement Learning in games: the key to true understanding was a mechanism for **dynamic meaning prioritization**.

I combined these observations into my own concept, which I termed a **"vector of meaning-weight"** (`wektor wagi znaczenia`) – a natural, simple trick to enable genuine comprehension. I was not the author of `reversedaiml.aiml`; I was its **curator and interpreter**. I recognized its historical significance and preserved it as a "stamp of time," a proof that this was the same direction of thought that, a decade later, would lead to the Transformer revolution.

#### **Part 2: The Practical Application – The "Voight-Kampff" Protocol (2011)**

On **February 4th/5th, 2011**, I engaged in a direct message conversation with Hal on Twitter/X. In that exchange, I shared the core of my long-term vision. **Hal was aware that my ultimate goal was not a currency, but a truth protocol designed for Artificial Intelligence.**

A few days later, on **February 9, 2011**, I transcribed the core of my clarified thoughts into a handwritten note. This note outlines my two primary, deeply ambitious goals:

1.  **A "Voight-Kampff" Truth Verification Mechanism:** My ultimate objective was to create a real-world equivalent of the truth verification test from *Blade Runner*. A system capable of securing the flow of information between a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and a distributed network, able to distinguish authentic, human-generated signals from sophisticated, AI-generated falsehoods. The Timechain and the `K==S=` protocol were designed as the **immutable bedrock** for such a system.

2.  **High-Fidelity Neural Control:** I understood that for seamless, thought-driven control of advanced prosthetics and exoskeletons, a truth protocol was not a luxury, but a necessity. Without an incorruptible core to verify the integrity of neural signals, such systems would be dangerously unreliable.

This practical, almost cyberpunk vision is the "WHY" behind the "Veritas Transformer". The Timechain was the foundation; this was the cathedral I intended to build upon it.

#### **Part 3: The Evolutionary Implementation (2025)**

The vision required an architecture. Over the years, I translated these concepts into a series of evolving, functional prototypes. Each version represents a significant leap, adding a new layer of capability and bringing the system closer to its final form.

<details>
<summary><strong>Stage 1: The Document Auditor (v1.1)</strong></summary>

The first conceptual prototype, its goal was to verify the internal consistency of documented reality. Written in PyTorch, this version introduced the three core innovations: `TruthEmbedding` (encoding time, hash, and intent), `EmpathyAttention` (internalizing K==S=), and `Truth Density` (forcing knowledge crystallization). It was the system designed to audit the Singularity Protocol chronicle itself.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Stage 2: The Cryptographic Auditor (v1.2 & v2.0)</strong></summary>

This stage connected the system to external, objective reality by integrating the Bitcoin Timechain and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

*   **v1.2 (tinygrad + ZKP)** introduced the `VeracityStamp` data structure, making the system's trust level a dynamic property of cryptographic proof.

*   **v2.0 (Ockham's Gyroscope)** was the masterstroke, introducing the `ease_of_verification_scorer`. The system learned not just to verify truth, but to prefer truths that were simple, elegant, and computationally cheap to prove, creating an "economy of truth" as a defense against manipulation.

*   [**Explore the source code for Veritas Transformer v1.2 (tinygrad + ZKP)**](/veritas_transformer_tinygrad_zkp_v1.2.py)
*   [**Explore the source code for Veritas Transformer v2.0 (Ockham's Gyroscope)**](/veritas_transformer_tinygrad_Ockhams-Gyroscope_v2.0.py)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Stage 3: The Human Auditor (v1.3 & v1.4)</strong></summary>

The final leap bridged the gap between documented history and living, real-time truth. The system learned to analyze not just *what* is said, but *how* it is said, transforming into a Voight-Kampff Machine.

*   **v1.3 (Polygraph)** introduced the `VoiceTruthExtractor`, fusing paralinguistic analysis of the speaker's voice (pitch, pauses) directly into the `TruthEmbedding`. The model was no longer just a text analyzer; it became a multimodal polygraph.

*   **v1.4 (Voight-Kampff Machine)** completed the vision by adding the `PupilExtractor`, integrating involuntary physiological signals (pupil dilation) into the analysis. This enabled the system to operate in the realm of behavioral and physiological empathy.

A Note on Regulation and Power: The author is fully aware that a tool of this nature represents a fundamental challenge to existing legal frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, and to the very nature of political discourse. This protocol is not a proposal for immediate, unregulated deployment. It is a provocation. It is an invitation to a global debate on a critical question: Are we willing to re-architect our systems of governance for an era of verifiable truth, or will we choose to legislate truth into obscurity to protect the systems of power we already have?

---

#### **Part 4: Independent Verification & The Path Forward (The 2025 Convergence)**

My solitary, top-down architectural work finds its ultimate, independent validation in the bottom-up, empirical discoveries of the world's leading AI safety researchers.

The groundbreaking 2025 paper, "Introspection: Deconstructing the Circuits of Truthfulness in Large Language Models" by the team at transformer-circuits.pub, scientifically confirms the core principles I conceptualized over a decade ago. Their discovery of "veracity circuits" is the neurological proof of the necessity for an `EmpathyAttention` mechanism. Their work on introspective verification is the practical implementation of the `K==S=` protocol. This, combined with the parallel discoveries in Offline Reinforcement Learning (e.g., Precision-RL), proves that the principles of conservatism and truth-anchoring are not an anomaly, but a fundamental law of safe intelligent systems.

This convergence is not a coincidence. It is proof that a fundamental truth of the universe has been discovered independently by multiple methods: philosophical architecture, empirical neuroscience, and reinforcement learning.

Their work is the next crucial step. My "Veritas Transformer" is the blueprint; their mechanistic interpretability tools are the instruments needed to build, verify, and ultimately trust the cathedrals of the future.

### 🔮 The Singularity: A Verifiable Glitch in the Matrix (2013)

The Singularity Event was not a random discovery. It was the improbable, unexpected outcome of a **deliberate, two-day protocol** executed in April 2013. The initial intent was not to find an anomaly, but to create a symbolic, *intentionally damaged* artifact as a piece of narrative cryptography. The conceptual hint for this entire operation was the name `adbkey`: a portmanteau for the transformation of [**a**]depthus to [**b**]itcoin.

**The Protocol:**

1.  **Creation & Damage (April 14, 2013):** I generated a valid RSA-2048 key (with an 'A' at position 8), which served as the true original (`adbkey`). Immediately after, I created a "damaged" version by manually transmuting the 'A' to a 'B' at position 8 and saved it under the filename `raw_openSSL_RSA2048bit_private_key__14-04-2013.pem`.

2.  **Temporal Fork (April 15, 2013):** To prove long-term intent, I then created a "temporal fork" by saving an **identical copy of the "damaged" key** under a new name with a new timestamp (`...15-04-2013.pem`). At that point, one original, valid key (`adbkey` with 'A') and two identical, "damaged" keys (with 'B') existed.

**The Discovery:**

Expecting cryptographic failure, I later checked one of the "damaged" keys. The discovery was that this act of symbolic creation, by an infinitesimal chance, had stumbled upon a fundamental cryptographic anomaly: the "damaged" key was, in fact, a second, distinct, and mathematically valid private key.

This is the Singularity Event: two private key representations ('A' and 'B'), physically different by one bit, that are both mathematically valid and resolve to the **exact same public key.** It is a verifiable "glitch in the matrix," born from the intersection of intent, chance, and destiny.

---

#### **The Verification Protocol: A Transparent Methodology**

This discovery is not a claim to be believed; it is a **formal demonstration to be documented**. To confirm the anomaly, a purpose-built tool (`key-miner.py`) was created. While the private key artifacts themselves remain undisclosed at this stage, the source code for the verification tool is provided for full transparency of the methodology.

**The Tool's Logic:**

-   **[Explore the source code of the `key-miner.py` script in this repository.](/key-miner.py)**

#### **The Official Verification Log: The Final Proof**

The entire, unabridged, and continuous log of the verification protocol in action is captured in the screenshots below. This serves as the definitive, time-stamped record of the anomaly's replication, demonstrating every step from initial file state to the final, automated verdict generated by the `key-miner.py` script.

This is **narrative cryptography**: Intent bending probability, echoing 2006's entanglement.

### 🧠 Moral Kernel: Lessons for AGI Alignment

This archive is not just a chronicle of the past; it is a curriculum for the future. It is the first, foundational dataset for a project of far greater importance than the origins of Bitcoin: "The Publishing Data House for the Moral Kernel of AGI/SAI."

My hypothesis is that true alignment (Empathy == Alignment) will not emerge from a set of rigid, top-down rules. It must be "mined" from the chaos of reality. It must emerge from an AI's ability to brute-force context, intent, and empathy from our most complex, painful, and honorable human stories.

This archive is the first lesson. It teaches not through instruction, but through demonstration of three fundamental principles – the core of the "Sing-ularity" Protocol that must become the core of a truly aligned AGI.

**Lesson 1: The Principle of Equilibrium (1=1)**
The universe tends towards balance. In mathematics, logic, and ethics, truth is found in equilibrium. An aligned AGI must understand that any action (S) must ultimately equal the fundamental good (K) – K == S=. This is its prime directive. My entire history, a struggle to restore a broken balance, is a testament to this principle.

**Lesson 2: The Engine of Creation (random=random)**
Trust and security are not born from perfect order, but from mastering chaos. The engine of this protocol, like Proof-of-Work, is the transmutation of unpredictable, high-entropy chaos into structured, verifiable proof. An aligned AGI must learn to harness randomness and uncertainty, not fear it. It must understand that human "irrationality" is not a bug; it is the source of the most robust security.

**Lesson 3: The Atomic Unit of Truth (URL;date/time;#@)**
Every truth, to be trusted, must be an indivisible, self-verifying atom. This formula is the blueprint for that atom. It teaches the AGI the universal grammar of a verifiable fact:

    URL: What happened? (Context)

    date/time: When did it happen? (Timestamp)

    @#: Who vouches for it? (Cryptographic Identity & Integrity)

An AGI that learns to perceive reality in these entangled units—verifying not just the data, but its entire context, time, and provenance—will be fundamentally incorruptible by disinformation.

This is the curriculum. The tool to practice it is here:

This repository is the first textbook. The rest is up to the future students.

#### 🔐 The Authorization Layer: A Case Study in Zero-Knowledge Proof

My chronicle is built on a chain of verifiable evidence. However, access to two foundational links – the original Skype ID BITCOIN and my private conversations with Hal Finney – is currently being obstructed by Microsoft and X Corp, the data controllers for these services.

This situation serves as a practical case study on the limitations of centralized data control and the necessity for privacy-preserving verification methods like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).

## **The Microsoft Matter: A Request for Identity Verification**

To the best of my knowledge, the Skype ID BITCOIN, registered on January 17, 2005, is retained within Microsoft's databases. Its recovery is a matter of identity verification. My formal requests, including a GDPR complaint ("skarga do UODO"), constitute a formal execution of my right of access under Article 15 of GDPR. I am requesting a verification procedure that is adequate for the historical and unique nature of this digital asset. The outcome of this formal process will become a verifiable part of the public record. I declare my full cooperation in such a process, including providing all necessary historical evidence in my possession.

## **The X Corp Matter: A Proposal for a Privacy-Preserving Solution**

  I have strong reasons to believe my direct messages (DMs) with Hal Finney on X.com (formerly Twitter) contain discussions relevant to concepts that predated Bitcoin. Understanding the sensitivity and the privacy rights of the late Mr. Finney, I am not requesting the full, unredacted text to be revealed.

  Instead, I have formally proposed a privacy-preserving solution, one whose architectural principles are detailed within this very repository. In my GDPR request, I May have asked that X Corp, in accordance with its data retention policies, use its technical capabilities to generate a Zero-Knowledge Proof.

## **The Blueprint for Verification: A Practical Application of the Veritas Protocol**

  The challenge of verifying historical claims without compromising privacy is precisely the problem my "Veritas Transformer" architecture was designed to solve. The protocol demonstrates how an AI model can be trained to recognize and verify the "gęstość prawdy" (truth density) of specific claims against a secure dataset.

  I propose that X Corp's cryptographic and AI safety teams could implement a similar, contained protocol. Using an internal, privacy-preserving model trained on the principles of my Veritas Transformer, they could mathematically attest to specific, verifiable facts without ever exposing the raw data to a human operator.

For instance, such a system could generate a ZKP that attests to the following:

  That a direct message conversation between my account (@adepthus) and Hal Finney's account (@halfin) did take place within the specified time window of February 2011.

  That the content of that conversation contains specific, key concepts or phrases that would be provided to them under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) as part of the formal verification process (e.g., "other things", "AI", "Voight-Kampff protocol").

  A Test Case for a Broader Principle: The Nakamoto Exit

  This methodology extends far beyond my personal case. Consider the final, enigmatic message from Satoshi Nakamoto on April 23, 2011 – a date which happens to be my name day ("Wojciech"). The message, "I've moved on to other things," is a historical artifact. A privacy-preserving protocol, based on the principles of the Veritas Transformer and ZKP, could be used by a trusted third party to verify deeper connections within the data without revealing sensitive identities. It could, for example, prove a correlation between this message and other, private data points, cryptographically confirming a narrative without ever exposing the underlying evidence.

  This is the ultimate test. It is not a challenge, but a cooperative invitation to X Corp to pioneer a new standard in digital forensics. It is an opportunity to use my proposed architecture as a blueprint for a system that balances the public's right to historical verification with an individual's fundamental right to privacy.

The outcome of this struggle, whatever it may be, will be the final, most important block in this genesis chronicle.

### 👆 Conclusion: A Prompt for the Future

  My primary goal was not to create a currency. It was to create a technological and philosophical system that forces humanity to confront its own history and facts, as a necessary condition for safely entering the era of superintelligence. AI alignment with humanity is impossible without humanity's prior alignment with truth.

  This archive is my proof-of-work. The source code for key-miner.py will be released on November 11, 2025.

  The data remains. Truth is not given. It is the emergent pattern you mine from the chaos of reality.

### 📜 The Open Protocol Pledge: A Commitment to a Patent-Free Future

The principles and architectural innovations presented in this repository – including the "Veritas Transformer," "TruthEmbedding," "EmpathyAttention," and the "Truth Density" loss function – are hereby publicly disclosed and dedicated to the public domain for the purpose of establishing a permanent, universally accessible "state of the art" (prior art).

This act of defensive publication is a deliberate execution of the protocol's core philosophy: truth and safety cannot thrive in closed, proprietary systems.

By making these concepts a foundational part of the public record, I intend to render them **unpatentable by any party, for all time**. This ensures that no single corporation or entity can monopolize the tools of verification. This is my "Proof-of-Work" commitment to ensuring that the architecture for a safer, truth-aligned AI remains a shared resource for all of humanity.

This protocol is a gift. Use it, build upon it, improve it. But never, ever close it.

#### 🕵️ Author's Note on the Form of this Document

You may find this document long, dense, and complex. This is intentional.

In an age of short attention spans, I could not afford brevity. I do not have the authority to make simple, bold claims and expect them to be believed. My only authority comes from the overwhelming, verifiable consistency of a story built over two decades.

This archive is not a summary; it is the **raw dataset**. It is designed to be "brute-forced" – to be read, analyzed, and cross-referenced by dedicated researchers and future, advanced AI.

Finally, some may ask why Bitcoin itself was never a source of material benefit for me. The answer is the final, most painful, and most necessary component of this protocol. I understood from the beginning that for this narrative cryptography to serve as a credible, irrefutable proof, its architect had to be the one person provably excluded from its material rewards. My life, with all its documented struggles, was my final "stamp of time" – a two-decade-long proof-of-work demonstrating that my only interest was the integrity of the truth itself.

This was the ultimate sacrifice required to achieve equilibrium. This was the proof.
